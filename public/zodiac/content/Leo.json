  "content": "Leo is a fire sign known for its boldness, confidence, and natural leadership qualities. You love being the centre of attention and often draw people in with your warm, charismatic personality. Leos have a strong sense of pride and self-assurance, which can make you very confident but sometimes lead to stubbornness. You are generous and loyal, always willing to support and uplift those you care about. <br /> <br /> Leos thrive in situations where they can express themselves creatively, whether through art, drama, or any other medium that showcases their talents. Your energy is contagious, and people are naturally drawn to your enthusiastic and optimistic outlook on life. At times, you may struggle with a need for validation and recognition, as your ego can be sensitive to criticism. However, your courage and determination help you bounce back quickly from setbacks. You are protective of your loved ones, often acting as their biggest cheerleader and source of strength. Ultimately, your confidence, generosity, and strong sense of purpose make you a natural leader who inspires others to follow your lead.",
